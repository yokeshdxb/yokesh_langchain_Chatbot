# Chatbot Integration with FastAPI and Langchain

## 🚀 Overview
This project integrates a chatbot system using **FastAPI** as the web framework, **Langchain** for model handling, and **dotenv** for managing environment variables securely.  
The chatbot interacts with OpenAI models, retains conversation memory, and is designed to scale efficiently for high concurrency.

---

## 🧩 Features
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async backend to handle chat requests.
- **Langchain**: Handles model orchestration, conversation memory, and context management.
- **dotenv**: Manages environment variables securely (e.g., OpenAI API keys).
- **Scalable**: Built for concurrent chat sessions and easy deployment.
- **Containerized**: Docker-ready for smooth deployment.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python **3.7+**
- FastAPI  
- Langchain  
- python-dotenv  
- Uvicorn

## 🧰 Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-fastapi-langchain.git
   cd chatbot-fastapi-langchain
2. Install dependencies
3. Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI key:
4. Run the application
5. Access the API

🧠 API Endpoints
POST /chat

Send a user message and get a chatbot-generated reply.

Example Request:
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "message": "Hello, chatbot!"
}'

Example Response:
{
  "response": "Hi! How can I assist you today?"
}

🐳 Deployment with Docker

Build the Docker image
Run the container
Access the app

⚖️ Scaling

Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple containers behind a load balancer.

Asynchronous Handling: FastAPI allows high concurrency using async I/O.

Stateless API Design: Easy to distribute across servers.

🔒 Security

Use .env for all credentials and API keys.

Apply rate limiting and authentication for production environments.

Do not commit .env files to Git.

📊 Monitoring & Logging

Integrate tools like:

Prometheus / Grafana for performance metrics

Custom logging middleware for API insights

✅ You can now **copy this entire block** and paste it directly into your GitHub `README.md`. It’s fully formatted and will render cleanly with headers, code blocks, and icons.  

Would you like me to include a **“Quick Start”** section (for users who just want to run the bot immediately)?
